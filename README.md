hello-world
===========

I'm going to write "Hello World" in various languages when I take study breaks (read: While I'm procrastinating). Or when I'm bored. 

I'm interested to see how long I keep this project going.

There are thousands of programming languages.
But I'll be starting with the ones I know and then move to the following two lists.
[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)
and

hello and helloworld have been added to the gitignore, for languages with compiled executables
