hello-world
===========

I'm going to write "Hello World" in various languages when I take study breaks (read: While I'm procrastinating). Or when I'm bored. 

One line hello world programs are sorta useless. All they say is how to call a print function in a language. 
For example here is python:

'''
print "hello world" 
'''

vs

'''
def main():
    print "Hello World!\n"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
'''

I know it's overkill: but it's also an example of how to call a very basic function. This is a repository of helloworld programs not hello world scripts. 

I'm interested to see how long I keep this project going.
Thanks to anyone who submits fixes and new languages.


There are thousands of programming languages.
But I'll be starting with the ones I know and then move to the following two lists.
[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)
and
[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language)

hello and helloworld have been added to the gitignore, for languages with compiled executables
